      Two-Face: I just the took to calling it the Bat. And yes Mr. Wayne, it does come in black.</p>

<p>Joker: Never start with the head. The victim gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next... See?</p>

<p>Batman: Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread.</p>

<p>Bane: Peace has cost you your strength. Victory has defeated you.</p>

<p>Bane: I'm Gotham's reckoning. It'll end the ball of damns you've all been living on. A necessary evil.</p>

<p>Alfred: Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just wanna watch the world burn.</p>

<p>Bane: It will be extremely painful... for you</p>

<p>Alfred: Batman may have made the front page but Bruce Wayne got pushed to page eight.</p>

<p>Batman: It was a dog. It was a big dog.</p>

<p>Bane: Your Punishment Must Be More Severe.</p>

<p>Bane: I am the League of Shadows.</p>

<p>Falcone: Look around you. You'll see two councilmen, a union official, couple off-duty cops and a judge. I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of blowing your head off in front of them. Now, that's power you can't buy. That's the power of fear.</p>

<p>Joker: This town deserves a better class of criminal and I'm gonna give it to them. Tell your men they work for me now. This is my city.</p>

<p>Alfred: I give a damn because a good man once made me responsible for what was most precious to him in the whole world.</p>

        <p>Yeah! Okay! Hello, boys. Dad! If youre hearing this prerecorded hologram message, its because I passed on, and my spirit sparkles guided you to its secret hiding place. Right now, Im holding both of you in my hands. Youre both still little squishy babies. I made you boys something. Its a dungeon. A proper dungeon. Full of evil monsters, traps, and magic.</p>

1. How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was tough! We both felt the assignment could be so open ended, that it was hard to start from a point. I showed my partner what I had created for earlier assignments, and then we tried building off of that along with his wireframes. 
After the wireframe, it felt like smooth sailing. We also worked together on 2.6, so by this point I was aware of his working style and I think he was of mine. 
It was about a 2 hour process, so at the end, it felt like we had really created something substantial, it felt good. :D 

2. Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes, absolutely! A wireframe is so necessary in order to finish with a solid product. Just like writing a 10 page paper, painting a masterpiece, construcitng a house, or building a rocket ship, working on creating web pages need planning and thoughtful drafts. 
Unless someone tells you explicitly what to make, line by line, pixel by pixel, you don't know what is needed on the page and you will need to wireframe it. 

3. What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
If it looked good and also if it was clearly showing that the user has landed on a blog post page. Therefore, all of the info one may need on a home page or the main blog page is not as necessary here. And if it was, then we put it in the footer. 

4. What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
Learned about main and article, as well as aside and footer. It's something I really need to work on adding more and more to my HTML voabulary. It certainly gives cause to wireframe and code in HTML more :)
