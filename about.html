	<h1>What is Brittney?</h1>

	<h2>A Little About Me</h1>

	<p>Hello I'm Brittney! I've recently moved to Chicago, Illinois from Ann Arbor, Michigan. I studied Psychology at the University of Michigan and lived in a large person co-op for 3 years. I previously worked as a build lead helping with upgrading U of M's computers and doing some IT support.</p>

	<p>I now am studying full-stack web development at <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a>. I graduate in May 2016, very very soon! I am interested in any dev positions using HTML CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, or Python.</p>

	<h2>My Passions and Hobbies</h2>

	<p>I enjoy drinking tea, especially black and oolong. Tea is delicious and each type offers an amazing experience.</p>

	<p>I enjoy crocheting. I have several projects in the works (2 year old blanket, multiple scarves and shawls). My favorite projects so far has been a long cat scarf, and R2D2 hat, and a rainbow shawl. I also know how to knit, but I prefer crochet (it's faster to make something, and not as many tools to buy).</p>

	<h2>How did I get interested into web development?</h2>
         <p>
          I spent a brief time in customer service providing support for online advertising. Most of the people I helped were small business owners and were trying to figure out online advertising to increase their business. While their business sounded amazing, their website didn't reflect modern online presence. 
        </p>

        <p>The odd times where small business owners weren't calling in, I spoke with marketing managers and full stop shops that helped craft and construct large and small businesses. They knew all the acronyms and tips and tricks to make people want to shop at a small ecommerce store. I thought it sounded like a intriguing avenue to take, so I started exploring jobs and skills. </p>

       <p>
         I began to see great community groups pop up like <a href= "http://www.gdiannarbor.com/">Girl Develop It Ann Arbor</a>, that encourage women to learn and advance in technological careers. I signed up for many classes and workshops ranging from HTML and CSS to WordPress and Intro to Java. 
        </p>

        <p>I also studied online at many free and paid services. For paid services, I really enjoyed Skillcrush's Web Developer Blueprint, Team Treehouse lessons, as well as great class deals on Udemy. The list is even great for free service, (maybe worth a blog post in the future :) ) </p>

        <h2>You'd be surprised to know about me...</h2>

        <p>I love to hula hoop! Give me a big open space where nothing can be broken, and I'll hula hoop to my heart's content. I know a few tricks, but nothing as fantastic as what you find on YouTube.</p>
