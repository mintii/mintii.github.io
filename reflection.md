# 3.5 Solo Challenge Add CSS To Your Website

## 1. What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

Padding is for pushing your content further inside of the box. So it's not pushed up along the border. 

Margin is pushing the selected content away from others. Kind of like a moat around a castle. To the untrained eye it can look similar to padding where you see a clear space between what appears to be the border and the text/image/background-color. 

Borders help to clearly define the space the content takes up. Just like a fence around a house, the border encloses it's most prized possessions. 

# Newbie take-aways 

Borders are great to place when you first start styling the page because you can see clearly where divs are going to and fro on the page. I prefer starting with margins first on pushing around content, because you can see if your widths are maintaining from any floats or positioning. Padding works best with any text wrapping or images within a colored div. Any times outside of that, I think it's best to stick with margins first. 

## 2. What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I'm still not very solid on what positions to pick when writing CSS. I often do multiple rounds of trial and error between `position: relative;` and `position: absolute;` before I can figure out which one I want. 

I referenced checked [www.w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com) on CSS properties throughout most of this challenge. And when I was trying to pinpoint where positioning was breaking or why divs were hiding, then I would throw parts of my code in JSFiddle to test things out. I also tweaked and reshaped things in Chrome Dev Tools to actively solve design issues (just saves some time so I needn't change windows).

I feel like CSS positioning was where I learned a lot about how web pages work. And through my learning, my knowledge and expertise on tools we've learned this week and last week also strengthened. It was a great challenge. 

## 3. What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Text is probably the easiest. Images and sizing and positioning divs were the most difficult. I feel both of these difficulties ate up a lot of time for me on working on this challenge. Between troubleshooting and researching how to fix it. 

## 4. What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

It's good to always think of CSS as Russian stacking dolls when working on divs because then it will allow you envision where styling need to be added or taken away. With this scenario,  each of those little stacking dolls can be molds of clay that you need to style and position. CSS is a lot like sculpture where small nudges and pulls over a long period of time will shape into something magnificent. It takes patience and practice.

A picture is worth 1000 words, and CSS has 1000 different ways to float a div. I learned that with CSS3 there's a lot of exciting new tricks that were easy to learn from and totally made sense in the intro knowledge I had about CSS. Helpful sites like [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) often will show how to traditionally create something on a page and how it can now be done in CSS3. We focused a lot on the perks of HTML5, but I find CSS3 an exciting venture to explore in the future.
