	<h2>What is Enumerable#cycle?</h2>
	<h2>cycle(n=nil) { |obj|block } </h2>

	<p>This method calls a block for each element of enum repeatedly n times or forever if none or
	nil is given. </p>
	<h3>But what does this mean?</h3>
	<p> Just like a looping, you can have an array do something again and again within the array. It can continue forever, or you can pass an argument to tell it how many times it should repeat. </p>
	<p>You can learn more about cycles by checking out <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Enumerable.html#method-i-cycle">this in Ruby-Docs!</a>  </p>
