    <h2>The magical importance of Git and GitHub</h2>

    	<h3>What are the benefits of version control?</h3>
      <p>
Version control keeps track of the changes you make to a file. GitHub helps with version control because it helps to collect and keep track of your changes. GitHub feels a lot like a social network where you can have friends and see what they are working on, and they can see your activity also. It's great for group projects because GitHub provides a place for everyone to work together, and if the possibility of a goof arises in the files, you can easily roll back to a previous version. 
      </p>
      <p>
      	Developers enjoy version control because it helps them to keep track of the changes they make in their code. Just like how a student has many iterations of a large research paper and they may break each version into drafts, a developer goes through similar steps. Git is great for showing exactly how different versions differ, and it allows for ease when needing to roll back on previous versions.

      	<h3>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h3>
      <p>
Git is a form of version control which you manage locally on your computer. Git can be used to help access files from GitHub, but the two exist separately where you can use both separately or in unison. 
If one were to make a layman analogy, I would imagine Git is like the remote to your TV where it can do lots of things specifically with your TV... in addition the remote can be used to access channels to cable TV. However, cable TV doesn't need your own personal remote, because it may provide it's own to you.       </p>
      	<h3>Why Use GitHub to store your code?</h3>
      <p>
			GitHub is a useful place to store your code because it encourages open source contributions and communities to flourish. Combining strengths of social media with version control software, GitHub is the perfect <em>hub</em>	for developers to visit, follow, and participate with others in creating content.
