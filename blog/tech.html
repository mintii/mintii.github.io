				<h1>Let's Learn about Recursion</h1>  
				<p>What's recursion, you ask? You're in the right place to learn! </p>

				<h2>Definition</h2>
				<p>A method can be considered recursive if it has an end goal and uses a reducing 
				process in which to meet the end goal. Recursion can be thought of as iterations in 
				Ruby or for and while loops in JavaScript. </p>
				<p>Recursion can be seen as breaking down complex inputs into simpler ones. When one designs
				a recursive function, each time it calls on itself it should be solely to reach the goal 
				of the base case (if not, you would create an infinite loop!) It's a great tool to use when
				processing or generating data with an unknown size where a one can instead make self-referential 
				definitions within the function (meaning inductive and coinductive definitions, which are 
				sort of like finite and infinite data. Read more about this here: 
					<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~micinski/posts/2012-09-04-on-understanding-coinduction.html">
					On understanding coinduction</a>.</p>
				<p>There are several types of recursive functions. For today's topic we will focus on single recursion 
				which is also known as linear recursion. This is a function that makes a single call to itself each 
				time the function runs. The classic example for linear recursive functions is with 
				calculating factorials of numbers.
				</p>
				<h2>Let's see it in Ruby!</h2>
				<pre class="code">
				  <code>
def factorial(num)
	if num < 0 
		return "Cannot calculate factorial of a negative number!" if num < 0
	elsif num <= 1
		1
	else
		num * factorial(num - 1)
	end
end
				  </code>
				  </pre>
				<h2>Let's check it out in JavaScript!</h2>
				<pre class="code">
					<code>
function factorial(num) {
  if (num === 0) {
    return 1;
  }
  elsif (num < 0){
  	console.log("Cannot calculate factorial of a negative number!");
  }
  else {
  return num * factorial(num - 1);
}
					</code>
				</pre>
				<p>As you can see, the structure is very similar to using variables where we are using the 
				name of the function to calculate things onto it. Linear recursion is the most simplest process
				of recursive functions, more advanced recursion can include indirectly calling functions from 
				other functions which then calls the first back. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<h3>If Recursion Appears so similar to iterations, why use it?</h3>
					We want to use recursion when we have to perform a complex task and we need to simplify the steps. 
				</p>
				<p>
					When you are deciding on a recursive function over other types of objects or methods, first determine the base case of the problem. 
					What is the solution you want solved out of the method? Think about how in our factorial functions it has one job: multiply each number together until we reach the end. 
				</p>
				<p>Next, your recursive function should include a lop that will iterate until the base case is reached. This is what looks most similar like the for or while loops in JavaScript. We can include a separate counter, or the actual number we give it. </p>
				<p>Finally, while we iterate to reach the base case, we should send the new arguments through the same function. </p>
				<p>

				of types available.</h3>
