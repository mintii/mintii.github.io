    <h1>Web Accessibility </h1>
    <p>I decided to read up on designing for accessibility in tech. I know it's a area in technology that's often behind or hardly innovating compared to the booming industry overall.Â 
    </p>
    <p>A lot of what I <a href="https://medium.com/@kategreenstock/graphic-design-for-the-visually-impaired-a-neglected-dissertation-211cc8c30b7b#.zaht0wdz2"  alt= "Graphic Design for the visually impaired; A neglected disseration">read </a>
    in terms of designing emphasized on simply knowing and using the HTML5 semantics that we learned together during week 2 where we learned HTML. It made me think that there is a super slow push to use it, or to even update current websites to reflect more semantic tagging. That's just plain lazy, don't you think?
    </p>
    <p>Approaching the creation of web content should be done with the idea that <em>all types</em> of people will visit and interact. </p>

    <p>"This can include people who are blind, color blind, or have low vision, those who are Deaf or have hearing difficulties, people with mobility impairments which may be temporary or permanent, or people with cognitive disabilities. Design for people who are young, old, power users, casual users, and those who just enjoy a quality experience." <a href="https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/7-things-every-designer-needs-to-know-about-accessibility-64f105f0881b#.87n6oqrpn">7 Things Every Designer Needs to Know about Accessibility</a>
    </p>

    <h2>So, what should I do to make my website more accessible?</h3>

    <<h3>Understand the guidelines already in place</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a>
    The same people who make w3schools.com also write extensive documentation on protocols and guidelines to make the WWW a better place. </p>

    <h3>Beef up your Toolbox with Web Accessibility Tools</h3>

    <p><a href="http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">WebAiM Contrast Checker</a>
    Did you know there's a recommended ratio one should have between text and the color behind the text? Neither did I, that's why we're both learning. It's 4.5 to 1 (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html"><Contrast (Minimum)/a>)! 
    </p>

    <p><a href="http://a11yproject.com/resources.html">The A11Y Project - Resources</a>
    The A11Y project helps to provide encouraging and easy to understand resources to help designers and developers work towards making their content more accessible. This page lists a very long (and most likely not exhaustive) list of resources and tools you can use to become more accessible. 
    </p>

    <h3>Check your CMS (content management system)</h3>
    <p>It is quoted that 25% of the internet has been built with WordPress. It is a powerful tool that many use, but is it accessible? 
    Drupal which is another very popular CMS released Drupal 8 which aims to be compliant to W3's accessibility standards with HTML5 semantic tags and improving navigation for eyes and by keyboard. 
    </p>

    <h2>Lastly...</h2>
    <p>Accessibility in tech helps bring more people to the table to enjoy the internet and what it has to offer. This is a very quick post on some directions one could go to get started. 
    </p>
    <p>In my personal life I have benefited from accessibility tools to help me with reading while in university. I have friends who are visually impaired and they are not living in the "dark" about the internet. One friend keeps her headphones on all the time, checking out Facebook with her iPhone! 
    </p>
    <p>Many argue that increasing accessibility leads to higher costs to implement and maintain it and there are efforts to analyze the costs of such implementation (<a href="http://ncdae.org/resources/articles/casestudies.php">Importance of the GOALS Cost Case Studies</a>). Regardless of costs, small goals should be set on a quarterly or yearly basis to reassess your content to make for better accessibility.
